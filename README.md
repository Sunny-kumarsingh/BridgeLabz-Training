## Week 3 – Day 1: Data Structures (Linked Lists)
**Date :** 2 January 2026  

###  Topics Covered
- Introduction to Data Structures in Java  
- Types of Data Structures  
- Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists  
- Singly Linked List: One-way traversal, efficient insertion/deletion  
- Doubly Linked List: Two-way traversal, extra memory usage  
- Circular Linked List: No `NULL`, useful for scheduling  
- Implemented insertion, deletion, and traversal  
- Improved understanding of nodes and pointers  
- Strengthened problem-solving skills
